For this build of the game, I've added a health bar, a mana bar, aim system, laser projectiles, super transformation 
that makes the player faster and increases projectile damage, and the enemies have a simple AI that follows
the player if close enough and will attack and damage the player. For the final build, I'd like to finalize
all the assets, and fix every bug possible and smooth out the mechanics.

Features that need to be fixed:
- Transition from normal camera to aim camera is still buggy
- projectiles sometimes fail to shoot out when flying
- improve the enemy AI
